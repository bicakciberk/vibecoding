# Clean Oceans Initiative

## Campaign Overview

Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste enter our oceans, devastating marine ecosystems and threatening the survival of countless species. The Clean Oceans Initiative is a comprehensive 12-month program designed to combat ocean pollution through direct action, research, and community engagement.

## The Crisis

- 8 million tons of plastic enter our oceans annually
- 700 marine species are threatened by plastic pollution
- By 2050, there could be more plastic than fish in our oceans
- Microplastics have been found in 100% of marine turtle species

## Our Solution

The Clean Oceans Initiative combines cutting-edge technology with community-driven efforts to:

- Deploy advanced cleanup vessels and equipment
- Implement innovative plastic collection systems
- Rehabilitate affected marine life
- Conduct crucial research and monitoring
- Engage communities in conservation efforts

## Funding Goal: $250,000 USD
