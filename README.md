## üêã About The Project

Clean Oceans Initiative is a revolutionary blockchain-powered fundraising platform built on the Stacks network that brings transparency and accountability to ocean cleanup efforts. Our platform enables donors to track exactly how their contributions are used, monitor real-time cleanup progress, and see the direct impact on marine ecosystem recovery.

### üéØ Why This Matters

Every year, **8 million tons** of plastic waste enter our oceans, threatening marine life and ecosystems. Traditional donation platforms lack transparency, making it difficult for donors to see the real impact of their contributions. Our blockchain-based solution provides:

- **100% Transparency**: Every transaction recorded on the blockchain
- **Real-time Tracking**: Live updates on cleanup progress and fund utilization
- **Direct Impact Metrics**: See exactly how many tons of plastic removed and marine animals saved
- **Community Driven**: Decentralized governance for cleanup location selection
